# 8bitSpace

A pixel-themed, folder-first cloud storage application built with React, Vite and Supabase.

## Features

- Supabase email/password authentication
- Google and GitHub sign-in through Supabase Auth (provider activation required before production use)
- Private user-owned folders and files
- Folder-first uploads enforced by the database
- Private Supabase Storage with expiring signed links
- Starred items, trash, restore and activity history
- Pixel avatar and profile preferences
- Responsive desktop and mobile interface

## Local development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the Supabase project URL and publishable key.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`.

The database and Storage setup is documented in `supabase/8bitspace-setup.sql`.


## Security and automated checks

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the safeguards in this repo, the SQL setup → hardening migration order (**do not rerun** `supabase/8bitspace-setup.sql` after the migration), local check commands, and hosted settings that still need operator activation. Run `npm test` and `npm run test:browser` for automated verification.
